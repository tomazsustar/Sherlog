- Increase crate version, build project again (also add Cargo.lock) and commit in git repo
- Set sfile password environment variable (trigger sfile.rs recompile if necessary - new rust compilers recognize the change and do incremental builds correctly)
- recompile with: `cargo build --release --features hide_console` to hide the console
- Run NSIS to create a release installer
- Test installer, in particular, remove C:\msys64\mingw64\bin from the PATH variable and make sure that the program finds all its dynamic libraries and runs properly
- Update release notes
    - show git commit:  git rev-parse HEAD
    - show sha256:  sha256sum NSIS/Sherlog-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe
